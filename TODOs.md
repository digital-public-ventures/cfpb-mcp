# TODOs

1. Add direct download links in README to full CFPB dataset (12GB) and sample subset (last 3 years, 2GB) and un-ignore data folder, but keep it empty. Maybe write a convenience script to download and extract into data/. Maybe specify small medium large?
2. Get cloudflare tunnel going for https
3. API to url mapping table for docs and nice utility function
4. HTTP Streaming for remote and node for full local stdio support
5. Create a fixed type for query params to avoid fabrication
