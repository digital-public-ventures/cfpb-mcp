# TODOs

1. Add direct download links in README to full CFPB dataset (12GB) and sample subset (last 3 years, 2GB) and un-ignore data folder, but keep it empty. Maybe write a convenience script to download and extract into data/. Maybe specify small medium large?
2. API to url mapping table for docs and nice utility function
3. Rewrite in node for full local stdio support?
4. Create a fixed type for query params to avoid fabrication
5. Implement gemini cli as web search agent for copilot, codex and claude
